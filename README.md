## Troubleshoot :scream:

If the output seems to be some text or the image doesnt seemed to be colored properly you may have a terminal app that does not support [True Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#True_color_(24-bit)) , you can find a list of terminal apps that do support it right now [here](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) and many others working on them.
